This is the same website i created and is up on the web at www.ggetchell.com, i created this same site using python's Django web frame work, picked this up from a tutorial on creating djangotemplates from Scotch.io site. I took about 3 days and over 7 hours of working to get everything to work properly, multiple errors and files/images etx not found. 
I enjoyed creating this as well as learning about the MVC framework.

The sit is being deloyed on Heroku ( i hope, sometimes not easy deploying anything nowadays.)
